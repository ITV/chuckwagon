The Chuckwagon Library is an optional layer on top of the AWS Lambda Library. It currently enables the following,

@ul
    @li
        A Scala friendly wrapper around the Java @lnk("RequestStreamHandler", "https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/blob/master/aws-lambda-java-core/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/lambda/runtime/RequestStreamHandler.java") working on the same basis as the @lnk("Underscore Scala and AWS Lambda Blueprints", "http://underscore.io/blog/posts/2016/02/01/aws-lambda.html").

    @li
        Helper Classes for constructing Environment Specific Configuration. This @lnk("very simple code", "https://github.com/ITV/chuckwagon/blob/master/lib-chuckwagon/src/main/scala/com/itv/chuckwagon/lambda/LambdaConfig.scala") uses the environment extracted from the ARN used to invoke the function in order to derive the configuration file for the associated environment. See the guide on @sect.ref{Environment Configuration} for an introduction to the topic.
